# Dare front End Exercise

Another interview exercise.

## Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is for Dare to get an idea of how you write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Please complete it to the best of your ability. You are free to use any framework or library to conduct this exercise, but please justify your choice in the ReadMe file. This exercise is not meant to be done in 2 hours, it is much longer. However please do not spend more than a couple of hours on it, we do not expect you to finish it. Just tell us how long you spend on it and what you chose to do.

## Instructions

We've provided a design, and would like you to bring this to life using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You will be able to inspect the sketch files in InVision without having to download Sketch.

The font to be used is https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans

- Text + image
- Form (on submit nothing should happen)
- Accordion (only one section can be open at a time)
Output
- Please either compress your code and send it to us as a zip, or provide us with a link to it
on your Github/Bitbucket account if you have one.
- Please provide a ReadMe file with any instructions on how to compile or run your
code, and any assumptions you have made.
- Please comment on your code where necessary.
- Please make sure your code works across the latest versions of each browser.

Good luck!
